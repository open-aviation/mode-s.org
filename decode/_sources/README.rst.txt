The book about decoding Mode-S and ADS-B data

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Begun with a frustration on the lack of technical public information on ADS-B and Mode-S in the year of 2015, I created an live online document to recorded my understanding of ADS-B data. Previously, this was known as `"ADS-B Decoding Guide" <http://adsb-decode-guide.readthedocs.org/>`_ project. Together with the tutorial, we also developed its related python library, the `pyModeS <https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS>`_. With time, I received many feedbacks, compliments, and contributions from open-source community users.

From beginning of 2017, the interests of tapping into Enhanced Mode-S (EHS) data brought us a whole new chapter of Mode-S inference and decoding into the pyModeS. This also enriches the "ADS-B" guide. With the advance in this area, I am planning to compile a more comprehensive online book to cover both ADS-B and Mode-S decoding and related topic.

That's the starting of this new repository. I am also starting host the online book on my own server to allow more flexibility of editing and publishing. You can read the most up-to-date book on `mode-s.org <http://mode-s.org>`_.

Oh, it is still GNU GPL. It was great to see the pull request from different contributors previously. I am looking forward to seeing more comments and pulls from the community. Enjoy!
